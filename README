This is the UI of the website that you see in my another repository on git called "Website"
This is just the UI of this website, which means it has not linked to any database yet. If you want to see the database of
this website, go to the "website" folder, follow the instructions, and you will be able to see a skeleton of the website with
no UI but with a functional database.

To view this page, a tomcat server is needed, and then fllow the steps below:

step 1: run startup.sh in terminal. (using command "./startup.sh")
step 2: type in "localhost:2048/storeWebPage" to your broswer.

Then you will be able to see the pages.
